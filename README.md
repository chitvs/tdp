# C programming exercises

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises taken from my university exams. Each exercise is neatly organized within its dedicated folder, encompassing both the source code and pertinent documentation.
The exercises are provided in chronological order based on their exam date, providing a structured approach for study and review sessions. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Matrix operations and arrays
- Linked lists and linear data structures
- Binary trees and tree traversal algorithms

This compilation serves as a valuable resource for students aiming to strengthen their understanding of C programming concepts and prepare for examinations effectively.

## How to compile and run

Navigate to the exercise directory and use `g++` to compile the C file. For example:

```sh
cd src/<year>/<month>/<day>/<session>/<eX>/
g++ -o main main.c
./main
```

> If your folder structure does not include multiple sessions or days, you can skip those placeholders.
